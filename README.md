ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a Task Management System developed in Java as part of the F28HS Object-Oriented Programming coursework. The application allows users to manage a list of different task types through a simple text-based user interface. It follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, cohesion, and low coupling, which are reflected throughout the code and explained via comments.

âœ¨ Features

Manage tasks of different types:
PersonalTask
WorkTask
TeamWorkTask
Add, remove, and display tasks.
Save and load tasks from a file on the hard disk.
Reminder system for Work and TeamWork tasks via a Remindable interface.
Unit testing with JUnit.
Text-based menu interface for easy interaction.

ðŸ“ˆ Development Timeline (Commit History)

This project was developed incrementally with a clear breakdown per coursework week:

Week 1-2: Task and TaskManager class creation, basic UI.
Week 3: Unit testing for add/remove functionality.
Week 4: Task hierarchy implementation, extended UI, and updated tests.
Week 5: Abstract Task class, Remindable interface, file I/O, and final test adjustments.
